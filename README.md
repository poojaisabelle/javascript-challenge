## Tasks

**[Automatic Table and Date Search](https://github.com/poojaisabelle/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-1)**

* The goal here was to utilise JavaScript and D3.js to append a table to a HTML web page and subsequently, append rows containing data for various UFO Sightings.

* Event listeners were a cruical aspect of this challenge. They were used to search through the date/time column of the table and find the rows that matched the users input.  

**[Multiple Search Categories](https://github.com/poojaisabelle/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-2)**

* The goal here was to add forms on the HTML webpage using mutliple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns so that users may filter the table based on the following criteria:
  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
