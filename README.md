## What was done 

**[Automatic Table and Date Search](https://github.com/poojaisabelle/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-1)**

    * The goal here was to utilise JavaScript and D3.js to append a table to a HTML web page and subsequently, append rows containing data for various UFO Sightings.

    * Event listeners were a cruical aspect of this challenge. They were used to search through the date/time column of the table and find the rows that matched the users input.  

**[Multiple Search Categories](https://github.com/poojaisabelle/javascript-challenge/tree/master/UFO-level-2)**

    * The goal here was to add forms on the HTML webpage using mutliple input tags so that users may filter the table based on mutiple criteria: 
        1/ date/time
        2/ city 
        3/ state 
        4/ country 
        5/ shape

    * Event listeners were a cruical aspect of this challenge. They were used to search through the date/time column of the table and find the rows that matched the users input.
